### Heyo :wave:

My name is Alexander and I'm a Business sciences student (B.Sc.). In my spare time I work on Minecraft tools, such as [PlotSquared](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/PlotSquared), [FAWE](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit) and a variety of other (independant) open source software.
